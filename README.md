# Data-Analysis-in-Python

## Introduction
This Project aims to use pandas, numpy, and matplotlib in Python to analyze different data sets. Furthermore, statistical concepts such as regression and hypothesis testing well be used.

## Process

### Assessing
We will start first by assessing a data set programmatically through the utilization of Pandas to identify quality and tidiness issues.

### Cleaning
After identifing the issues in the data set we will begin the cleaning process which will be aimed to fix all structure problems as well as removing untidiness.

### Proposing Questions
This step is related to asking question that is of practical concern as an attempt to solve real-life problems.

### Visualization & Conclusion
In this step of analyzin the data set, we will visualize the result and try to answer the proposed questions in the first step.
