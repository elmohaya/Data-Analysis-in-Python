# Data-Analysis-in-Python

## Introduction
This Project aims to use pandas, numpy, and matplotlib in Python to analyze different data sets. Furthermore, statistical concepts such as regression and hypothesis testing will be used.

## Process

### Assessing
We will start first by assessing a data set programmatically through the utilization of Pandas to identify quality and tidiness issues.

### Cleaning
After identifying the issues in the data set we will begin the cleaning process which will be aimed to fix all structure, content, and tidiness problems.

### Proposing Questions
This step is related to asking questions that are of practical concerns as an attempt to solve real-life problems.

### Visualization & Conclusion
In this step of analyzing the data set, we will visualize the results and try to answer the proposed questions in the previous step.

_ŸêNote: In some cases these steps may not be applied in the same order._
