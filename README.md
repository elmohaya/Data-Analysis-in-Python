# Data Analysis in Python

## Introduction
This Project aims to use pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and seaborn in Python to analyze different data sets. Furthermore, statistical concepts such as regression and hypothesis testing will be used.

## Process

### Assessing
We will start first by assessing a data set programmatically through the utilization of Pandas to identify quality and tidiness issues. Quality issues are related to incompletness, validity, accuracy, and consistincy. On the other hand tidiness issues are related to balancing the number of columns and variables, and merging tables that are of the same observational unit.

### Cleaning
After identifying the issues in the data set we will begin the cleaning process which will be aimed to fix all structure, content, and tidiness problems.

### Proposing Questions
This step is related to asking questions that are of practical concerns as an attempt to solve real-life problems.

### Visualization & Conclusion
In this step of analyzing the data set, we will visualize the results and try to answer the proposed questions in the previous steps.

_ŸêNote: In some cases on step may be missing or they might not be applied in the same order._
